# @mymahjong/core

The core package implements a very small subset of Mahjong mechanics in TypeScript. It defines the tiles, wall, player hands and a simple `Game` class for drawing and discarding tiles.

This package is framework agnostic and can be used from Node.js or the browser. See the tests in `test/` for basic usage examples.
