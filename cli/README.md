# @mymahjong/cli

A tiny command line interface that demonstrates the core Mahjong engine. After building, run `npm start -w cli` and follow the prompts to draw and discard tiles.

This package is intended for experimentation and is not a full Mahjong game.

The helpers under `src/UI.ts` simply convert tiles to strings and prompt the
user. Features like colored output or Unicode tile symbols are future work.
